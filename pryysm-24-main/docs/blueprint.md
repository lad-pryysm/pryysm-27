## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light gray (#F5F7FA) for a clean, uncluttered interface.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9800) to highlight key performance indicators and calls to action, such as the manage inventory button. It is analogous to blue, yet different enough to signal importance.
- Body and headline font: 'Roboto' sans-serif, providing a balance of modernity and readability for all dashboard elements.
- Use Font Awesome icons for a consistent visual language across the dashboard. The goal is clear communication with visual brevity.
- Grid-based layout for responsive design and easy content organization.
